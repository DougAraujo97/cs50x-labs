I'd say this listener's aura is yellow and purple
because their danceability and energy are relatively high,
but the valence or "positivity" to the music they listen to is
slightly below average. this gives me the impression that they
play varied genres of music throughout the day, giving a balance between
happier, more upbeat songs, and calmer songs to help focus.
I'd still say they are more purple than yellow, because of how high the danceability
is. I'd assume they like to get up and move.

in regards to how this aura may not be very accurate, I'd say it's because
I have a list of the 100 songs they've heard the most, but I don't know how many
times they've played each specific song. If I play a sad song 1000 times, and 10
different happy songs once, Spotify might assume I'm a happier person than I am, based on
how many more happy songs are in my list. I would try to base the average valence, energy and
danceability in how many streams I've given each song, and not just on the fact that I've
played the song in the first place.
